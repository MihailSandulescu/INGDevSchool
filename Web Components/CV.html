              provide the answer section of the books, and editing the layout of the book

            <p>
              The team I was part of had the task of verifying that certain features of the
              assigned video game were implemented according to the project design. My
              role in the team was to perform all the tests specified in the team's checklist,
              communicate the results to the foreign QA teams and ensure that previous
              deviations from the wanted design were successfully corrected.
