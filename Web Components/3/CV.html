      <h1>Mihail Sandulescu</h1>
      <p>
        I am working towards finding new ways of improving everyday life using my passion for Computer Science & Technology. 
        I would describe myself as a sociable, organized and motivated person. 
        Some of my areas of interest include Web Technologies, Object-Oriented Programming, Databases, Networking. 
        Constantly trying to improve myself, I am searching for oportunities to further my knowledge.

            <p><i>Booklet SRL</i></p>
            <p>
              More than just spellchecking, my tasks included assuring the fact that the
              exercises respect the current curriculum, solving all the exercises in order to
              provide the answer section of the books, and editing the layout of the book
              with Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign.

            <p><i>Electronic Arts</i></p>
            <p>
              The team I was part of had the task of verifying that certain features of the
              assigned video game were implemented according to the project design. My
              role in the team was to perform all the tests specified in the team's checklist,
              communicate the results to the foreign QA teams and ensure that previous
              deviations from the wanted design were successfully corrected.
